# StockWatcher
My first official iOS app. The idea is to more effectively automate how to tell when to buy stocks. In spending several
years trying to find an app that tracks the cost of a stock using common indicators, I've yet to find something that 
goes with my attitude of trading: know when the "buy low" point is (which is always determinable) as well as the "sell high."

## Ideal Strategy
Simply put, some energy will be spent getting this app off the ground as I'm finishing off my Big Nerd Ranch projects.

Here's how it will go:

1. Mock-up the flow: Nail down an overall flow of how the app will act. Nothing too complicated at this point; need to get to
MVP.
2. Mock-up the screens: Same as flow, except that here we're going to put some skin on the frame.
3. Translate mock-ups to Xcode: Get the designs on controllers.
4. Code, test, fix (which really means research times ten thousand), repeat: Get the app up and running.
5. Ship: Once stable, submit the app to Apple's App Store.

Nothing too ambitious, eh? :)

## Actual Strategy
The Ideal Strategy assumes I really know what I'm doing from a coding viewpoint, and I'm only just now getting to where I'm understanding certain things. Thankfully, Apple's own intro guide to Swift has provided a reasonable launching pad for this app of mine.

As such, here's how it will go:

1. Create basic functionality: Put together a list of names and tickers for stocks; be able to Move/Add/Change
2. Build on the basics: Build out detail pages for stocks such that additional stats can be added
3. Create functionality for portfolio variable: Build out page to input portfolio parameters
4. CHECKPOINT: Is app usable at this stage? If yes, then proceed to build upon basics
5. Integrate name/ticker recognition on Move/Add/Change: Enter name, ticker autofills, and vice versa
6. Integrate XML/JSON for stats: SMAs to be automated!
7. Refactor stock list for indicators: Can I see at a glance when I should buy/sell?
8. Integrate push notifications
9. Integrate watch list import/export?
10. Are we ready for the App Store yet??
